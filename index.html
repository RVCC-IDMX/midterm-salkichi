                <p>I heard about this place on YouTube assuming it was just a gag. No, it was real. I even saw Jones himself when I went there. The food was good, I had a couple of ribs with my friends. However, the guy in the dinosaur costume stood over our shoulders the whole time we were there. He kept pointing at my feet and showing off a selection of sauces. I know this place offers foot massages, but… I can’t say it didn’t give me the creeps.</p>
